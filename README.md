# AI-Enabled-Plant-Disease-Detection

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION -** This model aims at creating an interactive platform that would help farmers identify farmers identify whether their plants are affected by any disease or not. The farmers can upload images of plant leaves and they get results of whether their crops are affected or not, and if affected, what disease it is. This can help the farmers in taking precautionary measures to minimize risks.

**DATASET -** The image data was obtained through online sources (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease), and pre-processed in order to enhance the results. Pre-processing involves partitioning the dataset into test, train and validation datasets, along with separating the images into different batches, rotating, rescaling, resizing and flipping the images in order to visualize them from different planes.

**MODEL DESIGN -** The backend of this project involved building a Sequential Deep Learning model (Convolutional Neural Network model) using TensorFlow, Keras and NumPy. The frontend involved building of an interactive webpage using react, flask and HTML.

**OUTPUT -** A successful CNN model that records an accuracy of above 90%.
